# AIMA-Search-Stratergy-for-Missionaries-Cannibals

Iimplementations of the search strategies available in the aima code https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java to form an Artificial Inteligence solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem.

We provide the path to the solution generated by our code, indicating each state it has visited when using: 
  1) uniform-cost search. 
  2) iterative deepening search 
  3) greedy best-first search. 
  4) A* search 
  5) recursive best-first search
